Problem 1. Mortality follows the following survival function
S0(x) = 0.1√100 − x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 100 = limiting age
Calculate that a new born dies between ages 19 and 36.
Problem 2. Mortality follows
F0(x) = 1 −   1 + x/1
Calculate
(a) p20
(b) 10|5q30

Problem 4. Consider a life currently aged x, let T be the time lived by (x) after the age of x + n. Find the distribution of T
Problem 5. A new machine component is assumed to fail at time T, where the force of failure is
µt =   4(10 − t)/1, for 0 ≤ t < 10
Derive the density function and the survival function for this distribution
